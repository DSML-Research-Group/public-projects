## DSML Research Group Public Github üëã

This is the organizational github account for the Data Science and Machine Learning Research Group's public projects and associated Discord Server.  

It's used as a central location for all of the organization's community works.  Individual repositories exist for each separate project.

Projects can exist as open source software projects that people actively contribute to, as well as empirical projects aimed at creating new results and discussing their work.  Contributions are entirely voluntary, and anyone is free to participate, although different levels of background knowledge are useful for being able to contribute.

## How Do I Contribute? ‚ùì

If you'd like to find something to work on, it's suggested that you do the following:
 - Browse through the issues section of this github repo to search for existing projects that have been volunteered by other people that you find interesting
 - Find the corresponding channel on discord to try and communicate with other people who are currently working on it
 - Go To Town

If you have something you'd like to work on and want to see if someone is able to help, you are welcome to submit your own issue and see if it can generate any interest.
